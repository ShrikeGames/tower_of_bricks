The theme this year was "Built to Scale".
Here you are literally building your way up by moving and placing toy bricks (legally distinct LEGO) in a Getting Over It/Only Up/Jump King style game.

There are around 60 audio files that can play based on your actions, where you go, how many times you fall, and more.

    WASD or Arrow keys to move and jump
    Mouse to look around
    Left mouse button to pick up a brick
    Left mouse button with a brick picked up (it will show above your head, and a transparent version around your cursor) to place it down wherever you want
    If you can see a brick, you can pick it up! Don't worry about the distance.
